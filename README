Tankbobs is a small 2D shooter game licensed under the GPL that is written in C
and Lua.  Much more can be written about it, particularly regarding its
scriptability.

I started developing this when I was 14 and essentially stopped working on it
when I was 15, but it's still left in a quite playable state as I remember it.
(My passion has since been Haskell, which I've since been studying, practicing,
 and using.  I highly recommend checking it out; it's absolutely stunning!) Set
your expectations accordingly, please.

I've moved this repository from mercenariesguild.net (Thanks for hosting it!)
to github.

I apologize for the unisolated large binary files that have dramatically
inflated the size of the repository, but it seems to be too late to cleanly fix that.

In most cases, running "./build.sh -d -o make" should build Tankbobs, where
"-d" enables debugging, "-o" to disable jit, and "make" runs make after cmake
(see ./build -h for help).
