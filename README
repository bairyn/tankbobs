Tankbobs is a small 2D shooter game licensed under the GPL that is written in C
and Lua.  Much more has yet to be written about it.

In most cases, running "./build.sh -d -o make" should build Tankbobs, where
"-d" enables debugging, "-o" to disable jit, and "make" runs make after cmake
(see ./build.sh -h for help).

I apologize for the unisolated large binary files that have dramatically
inflated the size of the repository, but it seems to be too late to cleanly fix
that, unfortunately.

I started developing Tankbobs in 2008 and have rarely worked on it since my
16th birthday in 2010.  (My passion for C and Lua has since been replaced with
an even stronger one for Haskell.  I highly recommend checking it out; it's
absolutely stunning!)  Set your expectations accordingly, please.
